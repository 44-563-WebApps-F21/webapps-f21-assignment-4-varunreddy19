            _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.

            [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
            armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
            _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
            _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]
        </h4>
        <p>
            LORD GORING. [_Genially_.] Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. [_Caustically_.] You can have till dinner-time if it
            would be of any convenience to you.

            LORD GORING. Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
            lunch.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. Humph! Never know when you are serious or not.

            LORD GORING. Neither do I, father.

            [_A pause_.]

            LORD CAVERSHAM. I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?

            LORD GORING. [_Airily_.] The Times? Certainly not. I only read _The
            Morning Post_. All that one should know about modern life is where the
            Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
            article on Robert Chiltern’s career?

            LORD GORING. Good heavens! No. What does it say?

            LORD CAVERSHAM. What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
            course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
            one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
            Canning.

            LORD GORING. Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
            did Chiltern uphold the scheme?

            LORD CAVERSHAM. Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
            denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
            This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
            out. You should read this article, sir. [_Opens_ The Times.] ‘Sir
            Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
            Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
            . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
            to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
            never say that of you, sir.

            LORD GORING. I sincerely hope not, father. However, I am delighted at
            what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got
            pluck.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.

            LORD GORING. Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so common, nowadays, as
            genius is.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. I wish you would go into Parliament.

            LORD GORING. My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the
            House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?

            LORD GORING. I am far too young.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. [_Testily_.] I hate this affectation of youth, sir. It
            is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.

            LORD GORING. Youth isn’t an affectation. Youth is an art.

            LORD CAVERSHAM. Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?

            LORD GORING. I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the
            morning.
