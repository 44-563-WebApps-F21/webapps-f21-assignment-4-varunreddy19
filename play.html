            _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.</h3>

            <h4>[LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
            armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
            _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
            _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]
            </h4>
        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING. </h5><p class="stage-direction">[_Genially_.]</p> <p class="speech">Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM"> LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">[_Caustically_.]</p> <p class="speech">You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5><p class="speech"> Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
        lunch.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5><p class="speech"> Humph! Never know when you are serious or not.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5><p class="speech"> Neither do I, father.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_A pause_.]</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM"> LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5><p class="speech"> I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="stage-direction" > [_Airily_.]</p> <p class="speech">The Times? Certainly not. I only read _The
        Morning Post_. All that one should know about modern life is where the
        Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5><p class="speech"> Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
        article on Robert Chiltern’s career?</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5><p class="speech"> Good heavens! No. What does it say?</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">CAVERSHAM.</h5> <p class="speech">What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
        course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
        one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
        Canning.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5><p class="speech"> Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
        did Chiltern uphold the scheme?</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <p class="speech">Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
        denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
        This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
        out. You should read this article, sir. [_Opens_ The Times.] ‘Sir
        Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
        Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
        . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
        to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
        never say that of you, sir.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING"> LORD GORING.</h5><p class="speech">I sincerely hope not, father. However, I am delighted at
        what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got
        pluck.</p>

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM"> LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5><p class="speech"> He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.

        
        <h5 class="name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech">Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so common, nowadays, as
        genius is.</p>
