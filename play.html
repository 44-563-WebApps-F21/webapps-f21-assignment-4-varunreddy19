        _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.<br>

        <br>[LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
        armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
        _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
        _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]<br></h4>
    <p>
        <br>
        LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.
        <br><br>
        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?<br>
        <br>

        LORD GORING. [_Slowly_.] Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
        is no doubt of that.<br><br>

        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_Bitterly_.] Men who every day do something of
        the same kind themselves. Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
        in their own lives.<br><br>

        LORD GORING. That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
        people’s secrets. It distracts public attention from their own.<br><br>

        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? No
        one.<br><br>

        LORD GORING. [_Looking at him steadily_.] Except yourself, Robert.<br>

        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_After a pause_.] Of course I had private
        information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
        the day, and I acted on it. Private information is practically the
        source of every large modern fortune.<br><br>

        LORD GORING. [_Tapping his boot with his cane_.] And public scandal
        invariably the result.<br><br>

        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_Pacing up and down the room_.] Arthur, do you
        think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
        against me now? Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
        ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost? I was twenty-two at the
        time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
        unforgiveable things nowadays. Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
        one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
        mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
        worked for, all that I have built up. Is it fair, Arthur?<br><br>

        LORD GORING. Life is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing
        for most of us that it is not.<br><br>

        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
        its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this
        century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one
        must have wealth.<br><br>

        LORD GORING. You underrate yourself, Robert. Believe me, without wealth
        you could have succeeded just as well.<br><br>
